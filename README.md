# Analyzing FIFA 19 Player Data
 
## Project Description
This project delves into the FIFA 19 dataset to uncover insights about football players featured in the popular video game. Using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn, we explore various player attributes like age, overall rating, potential, and market value to identify patterns and trends. The goal is to understand the dynamics of player performance, growth potential, and market valuation in the FIFA 19 universe.
